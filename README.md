## Accompanying code for the dissertaition project "Studying the Sufficiency of Solving Proper Sudoku via Linear Programming" submitted by Billie Harris for the degree of MSc Operational Research at the University of Edinburgh. 

The code created to conduct the runtime experiment discussed in Section 3.2 of the paper can be found in the "Runtime Experiments" folder. 
The 4000 sudoku puzzles of varying difficulty used to conduct this experiment can be found within the "Data" folder ("Easy Sudokus.txt", "Medium Sudokus.txt", "Hard Sudokus.txt" and "Diabolical Sudokus.txt"). 

The folder "Sufficiency of LP Experiments" contains all code mentioned in Section 4 of the report, for studying the sufficiency of Linear Programming for proper sudoku. All data for these experiments can be found within the "Data" folder.
